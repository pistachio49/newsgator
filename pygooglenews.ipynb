The officer told deputies he believed the people in the vehicle could be “casing” for an ATM to steal in the Archie area, according to court documents.\\n\\nAs officers responded to the area, they received a call about a break-in at an Archie gas station.\\n\\nDeputies arrived in the area and located the suspects’ truck around 4 a.m. The officers began chasing the suspects along northbound Interstate 49, when they refused to stop. The probable cause statement shows speeds during the chase reached 100 mph.\\n\\nOfficers stopped the suspect’s vehicle just south of J Highway in Peculiar.\\n\\nThe two men then ran away from the vehicle. Deputies used drones and K-9s to search for the suspects. During the search, deputies reported finding a gun in the suspects’ truck along with a cell phone that belonged to Fell.\\n\\nOfficers eventually located Johnson and Fell and arrested them.\\n\\nWhile some deputies searched for the two suspects, others turned their attention to the crime scene.\\n\\nAccording to the probable cause statement, surveillance video from the gas station showed the suspects breaking through glass to get into the business. They ripped the ATM from the wall and pushed it out the way they entered, according to the video. Deputies said the two men were inside the gas station for less than 90 seconds.\\n\\nCourt documents show both men confessed to the ATM theft.

Sewell, the Commissioner of the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”), announced the unsealing of a two-count Complaint today charging RAMDEO BALLIRAM and LEONARDO ORTIZ with bank theft and conspiracy to commit bank theft in connection with a years-long scheme in which they stole more than $1 million from Automated Teller Machines (“ATMs”) located in commercial establishments throughout the Bronx. BALLIRAM and ORTIZ were arrested today and will be presented before U.S. Magistrate Judge James L. Cott.\\n\\nU.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “As alleged, the defendants carried out a calculated scheme for years, stealing over a million dollars from ATMs in businesses throughout the Bronx. The relentless efforts of this Office and our law enforcement partners have finally put an end to the burglaries and thefts allegedly perpetrated by the defendants, and we will continue to be diligent in seeking justice for those affected by these crimes.”\\n\\nNYPD Commissioner Keechant L. Sewell said: “For nearly two years, these defendants allegedly targeted multiple small businesses in the Bronx – burglarizing, ransacking, and stealing more than $1 million. Their brazen scheme undermined public safety throughout an entire borough, and today’s complaint is the next step toward holding them accountable for their crimes. Thank you to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and all the NYPD investigators who worked together to bring charges in this case.”\\n\\nAccording to the allegations contained in the Complaint:[1]\\n\\nFrom at least in or about March 2021 through in or about January 2023, BALLIRAM, ORTIZ, and another individual (“CC-1”) engaged in a series of at least 23 burglaries of commercial establishments throughout the Bronx, in which they stole over $1 million from ATMs.\\n\\nThe burglaries followed a simple pattern: on each occasion, BALLIRAM, ORTIZ, and at least one other individual broke into Bronx small businesses — often bodegas or restaurants — in the middle of the night in order to steal all the cash from the ATM inside the store. In the course of stealing all the cash from the ATMs, BALLIRAM and ORTIZ also ransacked each store, stealing all the cash from the register, cigarettes, lottery tickets, alcohol, and digital video recording systems. BALLIRAM and ORTIZ stole tens of thousands of dollars in cash and valuables each time.\\n\\nBALLIRAM and ORTIZ serially followed an armored car (“Bank Van-1”) as it refilled ATMs throughout the Bronx on behalf of a particular bank in order to determine which ATMs to target. Once BALLIRAM and ORTIZ learned which ATMs had been refilled, they then traveled to that location to break into the store and steal the cash. BALLIRAM and ORTIZ often used sophisticated tools to break into both the commercial establishments and the ATMs, as pictured below. On the occasion pictured below, BALLIRAM and ORTIZ stole more than $77,000 from the ATM:\\n\\nOn a few occasions, when they were unable to break into the ATM to steal the cash, BALLIRAM and ORTIZ stole the entire ATM. On at least one occasion, BALLIRAM and ORTIZ also used a stolen vehicle to carry out the scheme.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nBALLIRAM, 44, of Queens, New York, and Ortiz, 52, of Queens, New York, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bank theft, which carries a maximum potential sentence of five years in prison, and one count of bank theft, which carries a maximum potential sentence of 10 years in prison.\\n\\nThe maximum potential penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants will be determined by the judge.\\n\\nMr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the NYPD, particularly Detectives of the Bronx Grand Larceny Squad, and the Special Agents and Investigative Analysts of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.\\n\\nThis case is being handled by the Office’s General Crimes Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jackie Delligatti is in charge of the prosecution.\\n\\nThe charges contained in the Complaint are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.', 'link': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3RpY2UuZ292L3VzYW8tc2RueS9wci90d28tZGVmZW5kYW50cy1hcnJlc3RlZC1zdGVhbGluZy1vdmVyLTEtbWlsbGlvbi1hdG1zLXRocm91Z2hvdXQtYnJvbnjSAQA?oc=5'}, {'title': \"ATM thieves use glue and 'tap' function to drain accounts at Chase Bank\", 'text': 'There\\'s a new warning for those who use the \"tap\" function at ATMs.\\n\\nATM thieves use glue and \\'tap\\' function to drain accounts at Chase Bank\\n\\nSAN FRANCISCO -- ATMs provide great convenience -- but they\\'re also longtime targets of thieves. Some use skimmers to steal your account number, or stand nearby to rob customers. Now there\\'s a new kind of ATM fraud -- and a warning to watch out if you use the \"tap\" function on your debit card.\\n\\nThe tap feature uses radio waves to access your account -- no need to insert your card. But, some Chase Bank customers say thieves used the tap feature plus some ordinary glue to steal their money.\\n\\nPamela Bongiorno shows 7 On Your Side with our sister station, ABC7 News, how she got scammed at this ATM. \"So I was using the ATM machine on the right hand side,\" she said. \"My partner was here, the guy next to him was here. I inserted my card, it didn\\'t work.\"\\n\\nThen, a man in line offered advice.\\n\\n\"\\'Oh, if you have a chip in your card, you could tap it,\\'\" Bongiorno said.\\n\\nSEE ALSO | How to protect your bank account from \\'check washing\\': Better Business Bureau\\n\\nSo Bongiorno tapped her card. This time it worked. She got her cash, thanked the man and walked off.\\n\\n\"And then the next morning I look at my bank account...\" she said.\\n\\nTo her shock, Bongiorno saw three more withdrawals from her account -- $940 was gone.\\n\\n\"I said to my partner, \\'That guy scammed me last night,\\'\" she said.\\n\\nThe same thing happened to Rob Bell at the same ATM. When the card reader didn\\'t work, a man leaned in.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t think anything of it, I just thought he was using the ATM,\" Bell said. \"\\'There\\'s a problem with the slot function. You have to use the tap function.\\'\"\\n\\nSo, Bell tapped his card, took his cash and walked off. Later he found two accounts had been drained -- $560 gone.\\n\\nJustin Sindelar tapped his Apple watch at that ATM, and withdrew $40.\\n\\nRELATED | SoCal couple loses $68K through fraudulent Wells Fargo account\\n\\nLater, he found five more withdrawals in a row -- $960 was gone.\\n\\n\"Wait a second, I definitely did not withdraw that much money,\" he said. \"I think someone walked up to the ATM right after I used it...\\'\\'\\n\\nVictims complained to the bank manager.\\n\\n\"\\'I\\'ve reported this to the police, it\\'s happening up and down Mission Street,\\'\" Bongiorno said she was told.\\n\\nThe manager told Bongiorno how the scam works - it starts with glue.\\n\\n\"She told me that they put glue in the card reader of the ATM machines. So you can\\'t, you can\\'t use your card,\" she said.\\n\\nSo customers tap their card instead -- and here\\'s the trick. When you tap, the account remains open for more transactions, unless the customer proactively logs out.\\n\\nSome customers don\\'t know this.\\n\\nBut scammers do.\\n\\nREAD MORE | How scammers used Zelle to clean out one man\\'s bank account\\n\\nThey wait for the victim to leave, then walk up and continue making withdrawals on their account.\\n\\nAll three victims filed a fraud claim with Chase Bank. All three were denied. The bank said the customers authorized those withdrawals.\\n\\n\"And that\\'s definitely not true,\" said Sindelar.\\n\\n\"I said, \\'This is ridiculous,\\'\" Bongiorno said. \"Why would I do four separate transactions right in a row? Right?\"\\n\\n\"They should have a picture of who actually did,\" Bell said.\\n\\nVictims said Chase would not review surveillance video because the amounts were below $5,000.\\n\\nSo Bongiorno filed her claim again.\\n\\nAnd again, and again. Chase finally replaced her money.\\n\\nAnd after our inquiries, the bank refunded Sindelar and Bell, too.\\n\\nChase told 7 On Your Side: \"When using an ATM, be vigilant in protecting your PIN number and making sure you have logged out of your account.\"\\n\\n\"I will never use that little tap function again,\" Bongiorno said.\\n\\nChase did not say why multiple withdrawals did not trigger a fraud alert, or why the bank did not review surveillance video -- but each transaction requires entering a PIN -- which the thieves had apparently captured. So always, cover the keypad, and log out before you walk away.', 'link': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL2NoYXNlLWJhbmstYXRtLXNjYW0tdGFwLXRvLXBheS8xMjkxMzMwNy_SAQA?oc=5'}, {'title': 'Pickup, ATM theft; Bank robber pleads guilty; Summit League Tournament preview', 'text': 'SIOUX FALLS, S.D.

However, a report from The Wall Street Journal on Friday revealed that these features are not enough to prevent thieves from accessing users’ data. With iOS 17, Apple should invest even more in anti-theft security features for iPhone and iPad.\\n\\nSmartphones are more valuable than ever to thieves\\n\\nSmartphone theft is not something new. However, the reasons behind these thefts have changed considerably in recent years. In the past, people stole phones to resell them on the underground market. Even when Apple and other companies introduced things like iCloud Lock, this didn’t stop thieves from stealing phones. After all, they could easily remove and sell parts of the device, like the display.\\n\\nBut as technology has advanced, we’ve been putting more of our lives into our phones. Our passwords, our credit cards, our bank accounts, our documents… and as shown by the WSJ report, such benefits can turn into a nightmare when all this data is in the wrong hands.\\n\\nFor example, a lot of banks today let customers do all kinds of transactions directly from their app without even having to go to an ATM or bank branch. This is super convenient, and it’s hard to imagine a life without these benefits. However, this has also made thieves even more interested in stealing smartphones.\\n\\nSo what? Smartphones have passwords and biometric authentication\\n\\nSome of you may be wondering just that. How would it be possible to access all the apps on a smartphone if the device is protected by a password, or even better, by Face ID or Touch ID? It turns out, criminals have found ways around this – and I’m not even talking about advanced exploits to hack the phone.\\n\\nIn one of the examples given by WSJ’s Joanna Stern, a group of thieves chooses a distracted victim to steal their phone. But before they do, one of the thieves discreetly records videos of the victim typing their password to unlock the phone. In some countries like Brazil, armed thieves even ask the victim for the iPhone’s password before stealing it.\\n\\nAnd unfortunately, Apple has loosened up its security system to let users do a lot of things using just the iPhone and iPad password. For instance, you can go into the Settings app and reset your Apple ID password using just your device’s PIN code. This can help someone who legitimately forgot the password to their Apple ID, but it also helps thieves quickly change the account password on a stolen phone.\\n\\nAnd even if you have Touch ID or Face ID enabled, you can easily skip such security authentication methods if you know the iPhone passcode. That’s because iOS asks for your passcode when it fails to read your biometrics as a fallback method. This means that anyone with your password can access your messaging apps, private notes, banking apps, and even Apple Pay.\\n\\nWhat can be done about it?\\n\\nThere’s no easy solution for this. As I mentioned before, there’s not much you can do when someone records a video of your password from a distance or even aggressively forces you to give them the password.\\n\\nHowever, Apple can do (and should do) a few things to make the thieves’ lives more difficult and to give the victims more time to find a way to lock their stolen phone and bank accounts. Samsung, for example, lets users create a protected folder with specific apps that can only be accessed under certain circumstances, such as when the phone is connected to the user’s Wi-Fi network.\\n\\nAlso on Samsung phones, users can disguise bank apps with different names and icons. This doesn’t prevent others from accessing them, but it makes the process more complicated. It can be enough time for you to call your bank and ask them to lock your account.\\n\\nBut the first thing Apple should do is remove the option to reset the Apple ID password using just the iPhone and iPad passcode. This is extremely alarming for a company that claims to be concerned about privacy and security. Most people use weak passwords for their devices, and Apple itself offers a 6-number PIN as the default option for iOS.\\n\\nNubank, a Brazilian digital bank, recently introduced a feature called “Street Mode.” When this mode is enabled, the app uses the user’s location and Wi-Fi network name to block some transactions. As a result, thieves are unable to transfer large amounts of money if the phone was stolen on the street. Even if they have the victim’s password.\\n\\nBrazilian bank Nubank lets users restrict transactions based on location and Wi-Fi network\\n\\nApple could implement a native API in the system so that every app can have restricted functionality based on the location of the device. And more importantly, Apple should force users to set a password different from the iPhone passcode in order to change such settings.\\n\\nHow you can protect your iPhone for now\\n\\nApple told the report that it will “continue to advance the protections to help keep user accounts secure.” While the company has yet to introduce any new anti-theft security features for iPhone, here are some things you can do to protect yourself:\\n\\nAvoid typing your password in public; use Face ID or Touch ID instead.\\n\\nCover your iPhone screen if you need to enter your passcode in public.\\n\\nOpt for a stronger password.\\n\\nDon’t store bank passwords in password managers or in your notes.\\n\\nEnable Privacy Restrictions under Screen Time and use a different PIN code.\\n\\nWhat do you think Apple can do to improve iOS security? Have you experienced any related situations?

This is a big deal because in 2022, organized crime groups began massively targeting EBT accounts — often emptying affected accounts at ATMs immediately after the states disperse funds each month.\\n\\nEBT cards can be used along with a personal identification number (PIN) to pay for goods at participating stores, and to withdraw cash from an ATM. However, EBT cards differ from debit cards issued to most Americans in two important ways. First, most states do not equip EBT cards with smart chip technology, which can make the cards more difficult and expensive for skimming thieves to clone.\\n\\nMore critically, EBT participants traditionally have had little hope of recovering food assistance funds when their cards were copied by card-skimming devices and used for fraud. That’s because while the EBT programs are operated by individually by the states, those programs are funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which until late last year was barred from reimbursing states for stolen EBT funds.\\n\\nThe protections passed in the 2023 Appropriations Act allow states to use federal funds to replace stolen EBT benefits, and they permit states to seek reimbursement for any skimmed EBT funds they may have replaced from their own coffers (dating back to Oct. 1, 2022).\\n\\nBut first, all 50 states must each submit a plan for how they are going to protect and replace food benefits stolen via card skimming. Guidance for the states in drafting those plans was issued by the USDA on Jan. 31 (PDF), and states that don’t get them done before Feb. 27, 2023 risk losing the ability to be reimbursed for EBT fraud losses.\\n\\nDeborah Harris is a staff attorney at The Massachusetts Law Reform Institute (MLRI), a nonprofit legal assistance organization that has closely tracked the EBT skimming epidemic. In November 2022, the MLRI filed a class-action lawsuit against Massachusetts on behalf of thousands of low-income families who were collectively robbed of more than $1 million in food assistance benefits by card skimming devices secretly installed at cash machines and grocery store checkout lanes across the state.\\n\\nHarris said she’s pleased that the USDA guidelines were issued so promptly, and that the guidance for states was not overly prescriptive. For example, some security experts have suggested that adding contactless capability to EBT cards could help participants avoid skimming devices altogether. But Harris said contactless cards do not require a PIN, which is the only thing that stops EBT cards from being drained at the ATM when a participant’s card is lost or stolen.\\n\\nThen again, nothing in the guidance even mentions chip-based cards, or any other advice for improving the physical security of EBT cards. Rather, it suggests states should seek to develop the capability to perform basic fraud detection and alerting on suspicious transactions, such as when an EBT card that is normally used only in one geographic area suddenly is used to withdraw cash at an ATM halfway across the country.\\n\\n“Besides having the states move fast to approve their plans, we’d also like to see a focused effort to move states from magstripe-only cards to chip, and also assisting states to develop the algorithms that will enable them to identify likely incidents of stolen benefits,” Harris said.\\n\\nHarris said Massachusetts has begun using algorithms to look for these suspicious transaction patterns throughout its EBT network, and now has the ability to alert households and verify transactions. But she said most states do not have this capability.\\n\\n“We have heard that other states aren’t currently able to do that,” Harris said. “But encouraging states to more affirmatively identify instances of likely theft and assisting with the claims and verification process is critical. Most households can’t do that on their own, and in Massachusetts it’s very hard for a person to get a copy of their transaction history. Some states can do that through third-party apps, but something so basic should not be on the burden of EBT households.”\\n\\nSome states aren’t waiting for direction from the federal government to beef up EBT card security. Like Maryland, which identified more than 1,400 households hit by EBT skimming attacks last year — a tenfold increase over 2021.\\n\\nAdvocates for EBT beneficiaries in Maryland are backing Senate Bill 401 (PDF), which would require the use of chip technology and ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity (a hearing on SB401 is scheduled in the Maryland Senate Finance Commission for Thursday, Feb. 23, at 1 p.m.).\\n\\nMichelle Salomon Madaio is a director at the Homeless Persons Representation Project, a legal assistance organization based in Silver Spring, Md. Madaio said the bill would require the state Department of Human Services to replace skimmed benefits, not only after the bill goes into effect but also retroactively from January 2020 to the present.\\n\\nMadaio said the bill also would require the state to monitor for patterns of suspicious activity on EBT cards, and to develop a mechanism to contact potentially affected households.\\n\\n“For most of the skimming victims we’ve worked with, the fraudulent transactions would be pretty easy to spot because they mostly happened in the middle of the night or out of state, or both,” Madaio said. “To make matters worse, a lot of families whose benefits were scammed then incurred late fees on many other things as a result.”\\n\\nIt is not difficult to see why organized crime groups have pounced on EBT cards as easy money. In most traditional payment card transactions, there are usually several parties that have a financial interest in minimizing fraud and fraud losses, including the bank that issued the card, the card network (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, etc.), and the merchant.\\n\\nBut that infrastructure simply does not exist within state EBT programs, and it certainly isn’t a thing at the inter-state level. What that means is that the vast majority of EBT cards have zero fraud controls, which is exactly what continues to make them so appealing to thieves.\\n\\nFor now, the only fraud controls available to most EBT cardholders include being especially paranoid about where they use their cards, and frequently changing their PINs.\\n\\nAccording to USDA guidance issued prior to the passage of the appropriations act, EBT cardholders should consider changing their card PIN at least once a month.\\n\\n“By changing PINs frequently, at least monthly, and doing so before benefit issuance dates, households can minimize their risk of stolen benefits from a previously skimmed EBT card,” the USDA advised.', 'link': 'https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/new-protections-for-food-benefits-stolen-by-skimmers/'}, {'title': 'iPhone users targeted in phone AND data theft campaign', 'text': 'Posted: February 28, 2023 by\\n\\nWhen is an iPhone theft not just an iPhone theft? When the user\\'s Apple ID and more, goes with it.\\n\\nWhen is an iPhone theft not just an iPhone theft? When the user\\'s Apple ID and more, goes with it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s what the Wall Street Journal reports has been happening over recent months. The paper interviewed a handful of people who fell victim to old-school phone theft while out in a bar. But it wasn\\'t just the phone that was taken.. In minutes, they were also denied access to their Apple accounts and everything attached to them, including photos, videos, contacts, notes, and more.\\n\\nSome of the victims were robbed of thousands of dollars in the form of drained bank accounts, money taken from Venmo or other money-sending apps, and Apple Pay charges.\\n\\nMost victims have shared the same story: They are befriended by a small group of two to three people. At some point in the evening, a gang member watches the victim entering their passcode (law enforcement says sometimes members secretly film this process). Then the phone is stolen, usually without the victim noticing.\\n\\nSome victims say they were physically assaulted and threatened into revealing their passcode. Others believe they were drugged and don\\'t remember how their phone got swiped.\\n\\nOnce the phone has gone, the thieves log in to the person\\'s Apple ID and change it to something of their own. None of Apple\\'s current security features—Face ID and Touch ID—can protect users from thieves who have physical access to a phone and know its passcode. Even the new security key meant to protect Apple IDs doesn\\'t prevent anyone from making account changes using only a passcode. Surprisingly, a passcode can be used to remove security keys from an account.\\n\\nDevice theft cannot be completely avoided. But, learning from the thieves\\' modus operandi, iPhone users can still take steps to minimize the likelihood of them becoming successful targets.\\n\\n\"People forget that what they\\'re holding in their hand is their entire life,\" says Sgt. Robert Illetschko, an investigator on iPhone theft cases in Minneapolis. \"If someone has access to it, they can do a lot of damage.\"\\n\\nHow to protect your iPhone data\\n\\n1. Cover your screen in public\\n\\nThieves use various tactics to get their victim\\'s passcode. This includes shoulder surfing and surreptitious video recording. When you\\'re in public, practice keeping your passcode out of prying eyes. One way of doing this is relying on a different lock method, like Face ID and Touch ID. Think of and treat your passcode as an ATM PIN.\\n\\n2. Strengthen your passcode\\n\\nMake your passcode one which isn\\'t easily guessed (so no 1234 here!). Even better if you can use an alphanumeric passcode.\\n\\n3. Add more protection to apps\\n\\nIt\\'s worth taking a look at the security settings in your banking and money transfer apps, and putting the strongest security on them as possible. Venmo, for example, lets users add a passcode—just make sure it isn’t the same as your iPhone.\\n\\n4. Use a password manager\\n\\nWe\\'re not referring to Apple\\'s iCloud Keychain password but a third-party one like 1Password, which offers biometric authentication.\\n\\n5. Delete photos and scans of important documents on the phone\\n\\nSince thieves can search for \"SSN\", \"passport\", \"license\", and other PII (personally identifiable information), it\\'s best to not have important files removed from the phone. If you really need to have important documents with you, store them in your third-party password manager.\\n\\n6. Act quickly\\n\\nIf you spot your iPhone is missing, sign in to your iCloud using another device and remote wipe your phone as soon as you can. Call your carrier to deactivate your SIM, too, so thieves can\\'t receive any SMS verification. Finally, change the passwords of any accounts you use on the phone, and revoke all access from devices.\\n\\nStay safe!\\n\\nHave a burning question or want to learn more about our cyberprotection?

Deneyvous Hobson, 36, and James Russell Davis, 34, each face robbery and conspiracy charges. Hobson was taken into custody Feb. 21, while Davis remains a fugitive. At least five others believed to be part of the group — so called because investigators say they carefully planned the holdups at a home on Chesapeake Avenue in L.A.’s West Adams neighborhood — remain at large.\\n\\n“The defendants in this case and the other co-conspirators are heavily armed and pointed their weapons at the victims,” which in each case were security guards, U.S. Atty. Martin Estrada said at a news conference at the FBI’s L.A. headquarters in Westwood.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn one holdup, Estrada said, “a firearm was discharged” by a robber alleged to be Hobson. Video of one of the heists shows masked bandits welding an AR-style rifle with a short barrel, an optical sight and a large extended magazine.\\n\\nThe bandits would force security guards to the ground at gunpoint, zip-tie them, and grab the money bags before fleeing.\\n\\nJames Russell Davis faces conspiracy and robbery charges, authorities say. (FBI)\\n\\nLos Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said detectives investigating the armored car robberies found connections between the crimes committed at various banks last year in Hawthorne, Inglewood and Los Angeles.\\n\\nMoore said the LAPD’S Robbery Homicide Division worked with investigators from other agencies to “knit together” the identity of some of those behind the heists, which were committed in daylight.\\n\\n“No guard or employee has been injured to date, but when you look at the tactics used here, someone compared them to the movies,” he said.\\n\\nDonald Alway, FBI assistant director in charge of the L.A. office, said the the bandits would conduct advance surveillance on the locations, using multiple vehicles and personnel. The group had drivers who would remain in their vehicles during the robberies, he said.\\n\\nThree weeks before the first holdup, at a credit union in Hawthorne, two robbers believed to have been Hobson and Davis were seen in a white Chevrolet Tahoe “for approximately one hour while a future victim, J.G. — a Sectran Security, Inc., armored car driver — parked his armored car and collected cash” from ATM machines, according to the criminal complaint.\\n\\nA bank employee noticed the men’s suspicious activity and called police. A police officer questioned the two, who provided identification with the same Chesapeake Avenue address, according to affidavit filed with the complaint.\\n\\n“Three weeks later, to the day — and almost the exact same minute ... J.G. was robbed while collecting cash from the same” ATM machines, Elizabeth Cardenas, an FBI special agent, said in the affidavit.\\n\\nThe suspects were three men who used what appeared to be an AR-15 and a handgun during the robbery, authorities said. They stole the guard’s gun and about $100,000.\\n\\nThe crew allegedly pulled off a similar heist about a half-mile away in Inglewood on June 9, stealing nearly $93,000, authorities said. A vehicle matching Davis’ Tahoe was “seen leading a getaway car within 30 minutes of the robbery on a nearby Ring camera.”\\n\\nAccording to court records, Hobson has previous convictions for robbery and assault with a deadly weapon, while Davis has a conviction for receiving stolen property and possessing burglary tools.\\n\\nAt least five other individuals believed to be part of the Chesapeake Bandits have yet to be identified. Surveillance photos of them can be seen here: WantedUnknownSubjects.\\n\\nAnyone who might recognize a suspect’s clothing or may have heard someone discussing their involvement is urged to call the FBI with a tip.

       " {'title': 'New Protections for Food Benefits Stolen by Skimmers  Krebs on Security',\n",
       "  'text': 'Millions of Americans receiving food assistance benefits just earned a new right that they cant yet enforce The right to be reimbursed if funds on their Electronic Benefit Transfer EBT cards are stolen by card skimming devices secretly installed at cash machines and grocery store checkout lanes\\n\\nOn December 29 2022 President Biden signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 which  for the first time ever  includes provisions for the replacement of stolen EBT benefits This is a big deal because in 2022 organized crime groups began massively targeting EBT accounts  often emptying affected accounts at ATMs immediately after the states disperse funds each month\\n\\nEBT cards can be used along with a personal identification number PIN to pay for goods at participating stores and to withdraw cash from an ATM However EBT cards differ from debit cards issued to most Americans in two important ways First most states do not equip EBT cards with smart chip technology which can make the cards more difficult and expensive for skimming thieves to clone\\n\\nMore critically EBT participants traditionally have had little hope of recovering food assistance funds when their cards were copied by cardskimming devices and used for fraud Thats because while the EBT programs are operated by individually by the states those programs are funded by the US Department of Agriculture USDA which until late last year was barred from reimbursing states for stolen EBT funds\\n\\nThe protections passed in the 2023 Appropriations Act allow states to use federal funds to replace stolen EBT benefits and they permit states to seek reimbursement for any skimmed EBT funds they may have replaced from their own coffers dating back to Oct 1 2022\\n\\nBut first all 50 states must each submit a plan for how they are going to protect and replace food benefits stolen via card skimming Guidance for the states in drafting those plans was issued by the USDA on Jan 31 PDF and states that dont get them done before Feb 27 2023 risk losing the ability to be reimbursed for EBT fraud losses\\n\\nDeborah Harris is a staff attorney at The Massachusetts Law Reform Institute MLRI a nonprofit legal assistance organization that has closely tracked the EBT skimming epidemic In November 2022 the MLRI filed a classaction lawsuit against Massachusetts on behalf of thousands of lowincome families who were collectively robbed of more than 1 million in food assistance benefits by card skimming devices secretly installed at cash machines and grocery store checkout lanes across the state\\n\\nHarris said shes pleased that the USDA guidelines were issued so promptly and that the guidance for states was not overly prescriptive For example some security experts have suggested that adding contactless capability to EBT cards could help participants avoid skimming devices altogether But Harris said contactless cards do not require a PIN which is the only thing that stops EBT cards from being drained at the ATM when a participants card is lost or stolen\\n\\nThen again nothing in the guidance even mentions chipbased cards or any other advice for improving the physical security of EBT cards Rather it suggests states should seek to develop the capability to perform basic fraud detection and alerting on suspicious transactions such as when an EBT card that is normally used only in one geographic area suddenly is used to withdraw cash at an ATM halfway across the country\\n\\nBesides having the states move fast to approve their plans wed also like to see a focused effort to move states from magstripeonly cards to chip and also assisting states to develop the algorithms that will enable them to identify likely incidents of stolen benefits Harris said\\n\\nHarris said Massachusetts has begun using algorithms to look for these suspicious transaction patterns throughout its EBT network and now has the ability to alert households and verify transactions But she said most states do not have this capability\\n\\nWe have heard that other states arent currently able to do that Harris said But encouraging states to more affirmatively identify instances of likely theft and assisting with the claims and verification process is critical Most households cant do that on their own and in Massachusetts its very hard for a person to get a copy of their transaction history Some states can do that through thirdparty apps but something so basic should not be on the burden of EBT households\\n\\nSome states arent waiting for direction from the federal government to beef up EBT card security Like Maryland which identified more than 1400 households hit by EBT skimming attacks last year  a tenfold increase over 2021\\n\\nAdvocates for EBT beneficiaries in Maryland are backing Senate Bill 401 PDF which would require the use of chip technology and ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity a hearing on SB401 is scheduled in the Maryland Senate Finance Commission for Thursday Feb 23 at 1 pm\\n\\nMichelle Salomon Madaio is a director at the Homeless Persons Representation Project a legal assistance organization based in Silver Spring Md Madaio said the bill would require the state Department of Human Services to replace skimmed benefits not only after the bill goes into effect but also retroactively from January 2020 to the present\\n\\nMadaio said the bill also would require the state to monitor for patterns of suspicious activity on EBT cards and to develop a mechanism to contact potentially affected households\\n\\nFor most of the skimming victims weve worked with the fraudulent transactions would be pretty easy to spot because they mostly happened in the middle of the night or out of state or both Madaio said To make matters worse a lot of families whose benefits were scammed then incurred late fees on many other things as a result\\n\\nIt is not difficult to see why organized crime groups have pounced on EBT cards as easy money In most traditional payment card transactions there are usually several parties that have a financial interest in minimizing fraud and fraud losses including the bank that issued the card the card network Visa MasterCard Discover etc and the merchant\\n\\nBut that infrastructure simply does not exist within state EBT programs and it certainly isnt a thing at the interstate level What that means is that the vast majority of EBT cards have zero fraud controls which is exactly what continues to make them so appealing to thieves\\n\\nFor now the only fraud controls available to most EBT cardholders include being especially paranoid about where they use their cards and frequently changing their PINs\\n\\nAccording to USDA guidance issued prior to the passage of the appropriations act EBT cardholders should consider changing their card PIN at least once a month\\n\\nBy changing PINs frequently at least monthly and doing so before benefit issuance dates households can minimize their risk of stolen benefits from a previously skimmed EBT card the USDA advised',\n",

       " {'title': 'Apple should really invest in antitheft security features for iPhone and iPad',\n",
       "  'text': 'Apple devices have always been known for their security features which include the Find My network that has received major updates in recent years However a report from The Wall Street Journal on Friday revealed that these features are not enough to prevent thieves from accessing users data With iOS 17 Apple should invest even more in antitheft security features for iPhone and iPad\\n\\nSmartphones are more valuable than ever to thieves\\n\\nSmartphone theft is not something new However the reasons behind these thefts have changed considerably in recent years In the past people stole phones to resell them on the underground market Even when Apple and other companies introduced things like iCloud Lock this didnt stop thieves from stealing phones After all they could easily remove and sell parts of the device like the display\\n\\nBut as technology has advanced weve been putting more of our lives into our phones Our passwords our credit cards our bank accounts our documents and as shown by the WSJ report such benefits can turn into a nightmare when all this data is in the wrong hands\\n\\nFor example a lot of banks today let customers do all kinds of transactions directly from their app without even having to go to an ATM or bank branch This is super convenient and its hard to imagine a life without these benefits However this has also made thieves even more interested in stealing smartphones\\n\\nSo what Smartphones have passwords and biometric authentication\\n\\nSome of you may be wondering just that How would it be possible to access all the apps on a smartphone if the device is protected by a password or even better by Face ID or Touch ID It turns out criminals have found ways around this  and Im not even talking about advanced exploits to hack the phone\\n\\nIn one of the examples given by WSJs Joanna Stern a group of thieves chooses a distracted victim to steal their phone But before they do one of the thieves discreetly records videos of the victim typing their password to unlock the phone In some countries like Brazil armed thieves even ask the victim for the iPhones password before stealing it\\n\\nAnd unfortunately Apple has loosened up its security system to let users do a lot of things using just the iPhone and iPad password For instance you can go into the Settings app and reset your Apple ID password using just your devices PIN code This can help someone who legitimately forgot the password to their Apple ID but it also helps thieves quickly change the account password on a stolen phone\\n\\nAnd even if you have Touch ID or Face ID enabled you can easily skip such security authentication methods if you know the iPhone passcode Thats because iOS asks for your passcode when it fails to read your biometrics as a fallback method This means that anyone with your password can access your messaging apps private notes banking apps and even Apple Pay\\n\\nWhat can be done about it\\n\\nTheres no easy solution for this As I mentioned before theres not much you can do when someone records a video of your password from a distance or even aggressively forces you to give them the password\\n\\nHowever Apple can do and should do a few things to make the thieves lives more difficult and to give the victims more time to find a way to lock their stolen phone and bank accounts Samsung for example lets users create a protected folder with specific apps that can only be accessed under certain circumstances such as when the phone is connected to the users WiFi network\\n\\nAlso on Samsung phones users can disguise bank apps with different names and icons This doesnt prevent others from accessing them but it makes the process more complicated It can be enough time for you to call your bank and ask them to lock your account\\n\\nBut the first thing Apple should do is remove the option to reset the Apple ID password using just the iPhone and iPad passcode This is extremely alarming for a company that claims to be concerned about privacy and security Most people use weak passwords for their devices and Apple itself offers a 6number PIN as the default option for iOS\\n\\nNubank a Brazilian digital bank recently introduced a feature called Street Mode When this mode is enabled the app uses the users location and WiFi network name to block some transactions As a result thieves are unable to transfer large amounts of money if the phone was stolen on the street Even if they have the victims password\\n\\nBrazilian bank Nubank lets users restrict transactions based on location and WiFi network\\n\\nApple could implement a native API in the system so that every app can have restricted functionality based on the location of the device And more importantly Apple should force users to set a password different from the iPhone passcode in order to change such settings\\n\\nHow you can protect your iPhone for now\\n\\nApple told the report that it will continue to advance the protections to help keep user accounts secure While the company has yet to introduce any new antitheft security features for iPhone here are some things you can do to protect yourself\\n\\nAvoid typing your password in public use Face ID or Touch ID instead\\n\\nCover your iPhone screen if you need to enter your passcode in public\\n\\nOpt for a stronger password\\n\\nDont store bank passwords in password managers or in your notes\\n\\nEnable Privacy Restrictions under Screen Time and use a different PIN code\\n\\nWhat do you think Apple can do to improve iOS security Have you experienced any related situations Let us know in the comments section below',\n",
